          <p>
          In the heart of nature's dance, we stand,<br/>
          A plea to save the Earth, hand in hand.<br/>
          Trees, ancient sentinels of the land,<br/>
          Whisper secrets of life, grand and unplanned.<br/>
          <br/><br/>
          Their leaves, like pages of wisdom, unfold,<br/>
          Tales of resilience, stories untold.<br/>
          Roots delve deep, a tapestry unseen,<br/>
          An ode to life's cycles, forever green.<br/>
          <br/><br/>
          Waters, precious essence of our sphere,<br/>
          Reflect the sky's colors, crystal clear.<br/>
          Rivers weave through valleys, life's veins they trace,<br/>
          Quenching thirsts, nurturing life's embrace.<br/>
          <br/><br/>
          Let's unite in harmony's gentle breeze,<br/>
          Under the canopy of a thousand trees.<br/>
          With every drop of water, every leaf,<br/>
          We sow the seeds of a brighter belief.<br/>
          <br/><br/>
          For in the shade of a tree's loving grace,<br/>
          And the embrace of waters, a sacred space,<br/>
          Lies the power to heal and to renew,<br/>
          A pledge to the Earth, pure and true.<br/>
          <br/><br/>
          So let us guard these treasures rare,<br/>
          With hearts united, showing we care.<br/>
          For in saving trees and waters blue,<br/>
          We save the world, for me and you.<br/>
          </p>
